The LLVM language tutorial

This is an exercise to follow the LLVM tutorial with some minor modifications to learn and 
understand the LLVm api. I am doing this because I plan on using LLVM IR as the code generation phase 
of a compiler and interpretor I plan on building in the future.

This is also just the front end of the compiler ending in IR generation.
It does not compile down to binary form of any architecture, but it does output llvm IR that you can compile yourself using
something like ```clang```
